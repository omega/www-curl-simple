0.100189  2013-09-02 11:19:11 Asia/Bangkok
        - No longer use new constants, use variables instead. Properly fix it for
          older libcurls I hope :P

0.100188  2013-08-28 09:12:03 Asia/Bangkok
        - Check for existance of CURLPROTO_HTTP before attempting to use it, should
          fix us so we work better with older libcurls again.

0.100187  2013-08-10 17:53:22 Asia/Bangkok
        - Change SYNOPSIS to work with Test::Synopsis

0.100186  2013-07-15 16:10:09 Asia/Bangkok
        - Make it possible to turn OFF ssl peer verification
          The default is still to be secure, but it is now possible to be
          insecure if you want (neilbowers)
        - Default to follow 5 redirects
          The number can be changed, and redirect follows can be disabled
          (neilbowers)

          There is no such module as Net::Server::Base damnit.

0.100180  2010-01-18 08:50:01 Europe/Oslo
        - Skip one test if we don't have Net::Server::Base installed

0.100160  2010-01-16 06:10:12 Europe/Oslo
        - Switch to filehandles for storing data, should perform better
        - Better documentation about return values [Marcus Ramberg]
        INCOMPAT: The return value for add_request is changed. It now returns
                  the WWW::Curl::Simple::Request-object that was added.
        - Added has_request and delete_request to help with multi-request
          handling [RT#46293]

0.05    2009-06-10 07:44:00+0200
        New options:
          - timeout: Set timeout for content in seconds
          - connection_timeout: Set timeout for connection in seconds
          - fatal: (defaults to true), if false, will carp, not croak, on errors.

0.04    2009-05-25 13:06:00+0200
        Set a default UserAgent header, since some services seem to require a
        UserAgent header.

0.03    2009-04-20 09:32:00+0200
        Bump version.

0.02    2009-04-20 09:11:00+0200
        INCOMPAT: Fix some compat issues with LWP::Parallel::UserAgent.
                  We now return an hash like they do, with objects that have the
                  same methods
        INCOMPAT: $curl->perform on a multi-request now returns objects that have
                  ->request and ->response methods, instead of the ->response
                  directly.

        Fix really bad response-fuckup.

0.01    2009-04-14 09:37:00+0200
        First version, very basic interface. Does not support everything yet
